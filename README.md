Whether you're showcasing locations, features, or moments, Spots is built to make each one stand out.

## Future Enhancements

To enhance this project, I would connect it to a database so that users can actually edit their profiles and the images displayed. I might also include an area for comments on the pictures or a way to share the pictures via text or an application.
